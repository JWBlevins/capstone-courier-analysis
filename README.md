## Comparing Courier Service Performance in the U.S.
## Dataset Source

This project combines two datasets to analyze courier performance across multiple shipping modes and companies.


1. **[Logistics Regression Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prachi13/customer-analytics)**  
   *Source:* Kaggle (by Prachi13, for educational use)  
   *Contains:* shipment-level data including mode of shipment, product cost, weight, customer rating, and delivery timeliness.

2. **[courier_companies.csv](data/courier_companies.csv)**  
   *Source:* Custom dataset created to simulate major U.S. courier companies such as FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL, and Amazon Logistics.  
   *Contains:* company-level metrics including shipping mode, average cost, delivery days, customer rating, and market share.

   ### Why These Datasets Were Combined 

The goal of this project is to compare courier service performance in the U.S. across different shipping methods and companies.

By combining shipping-level data (from Kaggle) with company-level performance metrics 
(from the new courier_companies dataset), we can evaluate how cost, speed, and customer satisfaction vary between couriers and shipment modes.

This integrated design enables the analysis of logistics efficiency, competitiveness, and service quality across different courier companies and shipment modes.

## Database Schema 
The database was designed using SQLite to support relational analysis between shipments, products, customers, companies, and freight index trends.  
It contains **five normalized tables**: 'courier_data', 'customer', 'product', 'freight_tsi', and 'courier_companies'.



## table 1: courier_data (from Train.csv)
 | Column              | Description                | Type                      |

### Relationships
- courier_data.customer_ID → customer.customer_ID  
- courier_data.product_ID → product.product_ID  
- courier_data.observation_date → freight_tsi.observation_date  
- courier_data.company_ID → courier_companies.company_ID  

**One-to-many relationships** (each customer, product, date, or company can have many courier_data records).



## Relationship Between Tables
Connection: courier_Data.Date > freight_tsi.observation_date
Type: One-to-many (one TSI date applies to many courier shipments that day)


ERD
## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

![ERD Diagram](reports/images/courier_service_ERD.png)

The updated ERD includes a new table, **courier_companies**, which represents major courier service providers such as UPS, FedEx, USPS, DHL, and Amazon Logistics.  
It connects to the **courier_data** table through the 'company_ID' field, allowing comparisons of cost, delivery performance, and customer ratings across multiple courier companies.
